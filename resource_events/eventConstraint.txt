eventConstraint
===============

The [master article for `eventConstraint`](../event_ui/eventConstraint/)
explains how to force an event to stay within a given date range while it's being dragged.
Additional properties can be applied to force an event to stay within specific *resources*:

	$('#calendar').fullCalendar({
		defaultView: 'timelineWeek',
		resources: [
			// resource data...
		]
		events: [
			{
				title: 'my event',
				start: '2016-01-01',
				resourceId: 'b' // start out in resource 'b'
				constraint: {
					resourceIds: [ 'a', 'b', 'c' ] // constrain dragging to these
				}
			}
		]
	});

The `resourceId` and `resourceIds` (an array) properties are available to you.

You can also apply the same technique to an [Event Source](../event_data/Event_Source_Object/)'s
`constraint` setting as well as the master [eventConstraint](../event_ui/eventConstraint/) setting.
