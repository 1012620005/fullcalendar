eventAllow
==========

The `eventAllow` callback, [explained in the master eventAllow article](../event_ui/eventAllow/),
gives programmatic control over where an event can be dropped.

In addition to receiving information about which date the user is attempting to drop the event upon,
it will also receive information about the *resource*:

	eventAllow: function(dropLocation, draggedEvent) {
		if (draggedEvent.id === '999') {
			return String(dropLocation.resourceId).indexOf('a') >= 0; // boolean
		}
		else {
			return true;
		}
	}
