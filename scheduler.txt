# Getting started with Scheduler


This document describes the settings for FullCalendar **Scheduler** plugin.
It supports the notion of **resources**, things that events can be assigned to such as team members and conference rooms.
The plugin also provides a new view called **Timeline View**, which is very good at displaying resources.
In the future, other FullCalendar views will display resources as well.


## Basic Usage

Include the fullcalendar *and* the scheduler plugin files:

	<link href='lib/fullcalendar.css' rel='stylesheet' />
	<link href='scheduler.min.css' rel='stylesheet' />
	<script src='lib/moment.min.js'></script>
	<script src='lib/jquery.min.js'></script>
	<script src='lib/fullcalendar.min.js'></script>
	<script src='scheduler.min.js'></script>

Then, in your JavaScript:

	$('#calendar').fullCalendar({
		defaultView: 'timelineMonth',
		events: [ /* events go here */ ],
		resources: [ /* resources go here */ ]
		/* other options go here */
	});
