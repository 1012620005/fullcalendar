# Getting started with Scheduler

The Scheduler add-on provides FullCalendar with additional functionality for displaying resources.
Some important terminology:

- <b><i>Scheduler</i></b> : the advertised name of the add-on
- <b><i>Resources</i></b> : things that events can be assigned to, like team members or conference rooms
- <b><i>Timeline</i></b> : the name of a new [Available View](views/Available_Views/).
  it has its time axis running left-to-right and is especially suited for displaying resources
  (and is currently the only view that is able to do so).


## Basic Usage

In the HEAD of your HTML, include the necessary FullCalendar *and* Scheduler files:

	<link href='fullcalendar.css' rel='stylesheet' />
	<link href='scheduler.css' rel='stylesheet' />
	<script src='moment.js'></script>
	<script src='jquery.js'></script>
	<script src='fullcalendar.js'></script>
	<script src='scheduler.js'></script>

Then, in your JavaScript, do something like this:

	$('#calendar').fullCalendar({
		defaultView: 'timelineMonth',
		events: [
			// events go here
		],
		resources: [
			// resources go here
		]
		// other options go here...
	});


## More Settings

A full list of Scheduler-related settings can be see on the main docs page on the right hand column
(Timeline View, Resource Data, Resource Rendering, etc).
