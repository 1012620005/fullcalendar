droppable
=========

Determines if jQuery UI draggables can be dropped onto the calendar.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
Boolean, *default*: `false`
</div>

This option operates with jQuery UI draggables. You must [download](http://jqueryui.com/download)
the appropriate jQuery UI files and initialize a [draggable](http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/) element.
Additionally, you must set the calendar's `droppable` option to `true`.

Here is how you might initialize an element that can be dragged onto a calendar:

	$('#my-draggable').draggable({
		revert: true,      // immediately snap back to original position
		revertDuration: 0  //
	});

	$('#calendar').fullCalendar({
		droppable: true,
		drop: function(date) {
			alert("Dropped on " + date.format());
		}
	});
	
	
How can I use this to add events?
---------------------------------

Good question. Please see the [eventReceive]() article. This is only available in version 2.2 and above.

To do this in previous versions, see the [external-dragging demo](https://github.com/arshaw/fullcalendar/blob/v2.1.1/demos/external-dragging.html).


Specifying Duration
-------------------

Data can be attached to the element in order to specify its duration when dropped. A [Duration]-ish value can be provided. This can either be done via jQuery:

	$('.draggable').data('duration', '03:00'); // three hours

Or via an HTML5 attribute:

	<div class="draggable" data-duration="03:00" />

If no duration is specified, [defaultAllDayEventDuration] or [defaultTimedEventDuration] will apply.


Overlapping and Constraining
----------------------------

When there is no event data associated with the drag, the areas where the drop is allowed
are determined by [selectOverlap](../selection/selectOverlap) and
[selectConstraint](../selection/selectConstraint).

When there is event data associated with the drag (see [eventReceive]()),
normal event overlap/constraint rules apply, such as
[eventOverlap](../event_ui/eventOverlap) and
[eventConstraint](../event_ui/eventConstraint).



[defaultAllDayEventDuration]: ../event_data/defaultAllDayEventDuration
[defaultTimedEventDuration]: ../event_data/defaultTimedEventDuration
[Duration]: ../utilities/Duration
