List View Intro
===============

A list view is a type of [Available View](../views/Available_Views/) that displays events in a flat list.
Only days with events are displayed.

Example `listWeek` view:

<img src='../../../pages/docs/_images/listWeek.png' width='468' height='259' style='box-shadow: 0 1px 4px rgba(0,0,0,.3)' />

A list view displays events during a specific interval of time.
There are 4 preset list views: `listDay`, `listWeek`, `listMonth`, and `listYear`.
If you'd like a different interval of time,
you can create a [Custom View](../views/Custom_Views/) with type `'list'`.

If there are no events during a specific interval of time,
the [noEventsMessage]() is displayed.


Inherited Settings
------------------

Many of the settings documented elsewhere apply to the list views, including:

- [eventRender](../event_rendering/eventRender/) - for manipulating an event list item's DOM
- [eventClick](../mouse/eventClick/) - fired when the user clicks an event list item
- [displayEventTime](../text/displayEventTime/) - can set to `false` to hide all event times
- [displayEventEnd](../text/displayEventEnd/) - can set to `false` to hide all event *end* times

The [dayClick](../mouse/dayClick) trigger is **not** fired when the user clicks a day heading in list view.
