updateEvents *3.1*
==================

Reports changes to multiple events and renders them in batch.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
.fullCalendar( 'updateEvents', *events* )
</div>

This method is similar to the [updateEvent]() method though it accepts an **array of events** as its main argument, to update multiple events at the same time. This reduces the number of event rerenders that must happen, for performance reasons.
