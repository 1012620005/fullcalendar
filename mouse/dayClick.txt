dayClick
========

Triggered when the user clicks on a day.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
function( *moment*, *allDay*, *jsEvent*, *view* ) { }
</div>

`moment` holds a [Moment](../utilities/Moment) for the clicked day. If the user has clicked on a slot in the
agendaWeek or agendaDay views, `moment` will have the slot's time.

`allDay` will be set to `false` if the user has clicked on a slot in the
agendaWeek or agendaDay views. Otherwise, it will be `true`.

`jsEvent` holds the native JavaScript event with low-level information such as click coordinates.

`view` is set to the current [View Object](../views/View_Object).

Within the callback function, `this` is set to the `<td>` of the clicked day.

Here is an example that demonstrates all of these variables:

	$('#calendar').fullCalendar({
		dayClick: function(moment, allDay, jsEvent, view) {
		
			if (allDay) {
				alert('Clicked on the entire day: ' + moment.format());
			}else{
				alert('Clicked on the slot: ' + moment.format());
			}
			
			alert('Coordinates: ' + jsEvent.pageX + ',' + jsEvent.pageY);
			
			alert('Current view: ' + view.name);
			
			// change the day's background color just for fun
			$(this).css('background-color', 'red');
			
		}
	});
