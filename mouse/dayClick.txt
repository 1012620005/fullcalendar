dayClick
========

Triggered when the user clicks on a day.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
function( *date*, *jsEvent*, *view* ) { }
</div>

`date` holds a [Moment](../utilities/Moment) for the clicked day.
If an all-day area has been clicked,
the moment will be [ambiguously-timed](../utilities/Moment#ambiguously-timed).
If a slot in the agendaWeek or agendaDay views has been clicked,
`date` will have the slot's time.

`jsEvent` holds the native JavaScript event with low-level information such as click coordinates.

`view` is set to the current [View Object](../views/View_Object).

Within the callback function, `this` is set to the `<td>` of the clicked day.

Here is an example that demonstrates all of these variables:

	$('#calendar').fullCalendar({
		dayClick: function(date, jsEvent, view) {
		
			alert('Clicked on: ' + date.format());
			
			alert('Coordinates: ' + jsEvent.pageX + ',' + jsEvent.pageY);
			
			alert('Current view: ' + view.name);
			
			// change the day's background color just for fun
			$(this).css('background-color', 'red');
			
		}
	});
