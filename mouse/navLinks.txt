navLinks *3.0*
==============

Determines if day names and week names are clickable.

<div class="spec" markdown="1">
boolean. *default*: `false`
</div>

When `true`, day headings and [weekNumbers](../display/weekNumbers/) will become clickable.
When clicked, these links will bring the user to a view that represents the day/week.

The destination views are automatically determined by the views that are in the [header](../display/header).
However, they can be explicity defined using [navLinkDayClick]() and [navLinkWeekClick]().

Example:

<img src='../../../pages/docs/_images/navLinks.png' width='397' height='223' style='box-shadow: 0 1px 4px rgba(0,0,0,.3)' />
