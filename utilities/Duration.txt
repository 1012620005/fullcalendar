Duration
========

Duration objects are used throughout the API.
They are a creation of the MomentJS third-party library
and can be instantiated with the `moment.duration` constructor.

> **[Visit the MomentJS Duration docs](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/durations/)**

Durations are sometimes used to express:

- lengths of time (ex: [defaultTimedEventDuration](../event_data/defaultTimedEventDuration))
- differences between two dates (ex: [eventDrop](../event_ui/eventDrop))
- times that are not bound to a particular day (ex: [scrollTime](../agenda/scrollTime))

In FullCalendar's API, most options that accept Durations also conveniently
accept anything that the `moment.duration` constructor accepts, including the following:

	"23:59"       // hours/minutes
	"23:59:59"    // hours/minutes/seconds
	"1.23:59:59"  // days/hours/minutes/seconds
	{ days:1, hours:23, minutes:59 } // an object
