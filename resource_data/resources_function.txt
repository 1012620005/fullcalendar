resources (as a function)
=========================

Tells the calendar to fetch the resources list by executing a function. The function is given a `callback` argument that should be called with an array of [Resource Object]()s:

	resources: function(callback) {
		somethingAsynchonous(function(resourceObjects) {
			callback(resourceObjects);
		});
	}

This allows for any sort of asynchronous means of obtaining the resource list.
