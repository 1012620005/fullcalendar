resources (as a function)
=========================

Tells the calendar to fetch the resources list by executing a function. The function is given a `callback` argument that should be called with an array of [Resource Object]()s:

	resources: function(callback) {

		somethingAsynchonous(function(resourceObjects) {
			callback(resourceObjects);
		});
	}

This allows for any sort of asynchronous means of obtaining the resource list.

If [refetchResourcesOnNavigate]() is set to `true`, the resources function will receive additional arguments. It will receive the start and end moments for the newly visible window of time as well as the calendar's timezone:

	refetchResourcesOnNavigate: true,
	resources: function(callback, start, end, timezone) {

		somethingAsynchonous(start, end, timezone, function(resourceObjects) {
			callback(resourceObjects);
		});
	}

These arguments are similar to what the [events function](../event_data/events_function) receives, though in a different order.

This `refetchResourcesOnNavigate` behavior is present in v1.5.1 and later.
