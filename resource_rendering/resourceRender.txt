resourceRender
==============

Allows manipulation of the elements associated with a resource row.

The first argument is the [Resource Object](../resource_data/Resource_Object/).

The second argument is the `<td>` or `<th>` that holds the name of the resource (jQuery object).
The exact DOM node depends on the type of the current view.

The third argument holds the elements that visually contain the resource's events (jQuery object).
The exact DOM node depends on the type of the current view.
Certain views might not support this argument, and will provide an empty jQuery set.

Example:

	resourceRender: function(resourceObj, labelTds, bodyTds) {
		labelTds.css('background', 'blue');
	}

This callback will not allow manipulating of *event* elements, as they will not yet have been drawn at the time of invocation. Use [eventRender](../event_rendering/eventRender) for that.
