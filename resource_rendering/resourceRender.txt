resourceRender
==============

Allows manipulation of the elements associated with a resource row.

The first argument will be the cell's `<td>` from the resources area, as a jQuery object. If [resourceColumns](../timeline/resourceColumns) is activated, this jQuery object will be comprised of all the `<td>` elements of the row.

The second argument is the container element for the events of the resource, as a jQuery object.

	resourceRender: function(dataTds, eventTd) {
		dataTds.css('background', 'blue');
	}

This callback will not allow manipulating of *event* elements, as they will not yet have been drawn at the time of invocation. Use [eventRender](../event_rendering/eventRender) for that.
