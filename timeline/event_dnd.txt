Event Drag-n-drop
=================

Timeline view supports the following two options for event drag-n-drop:

- [eventDrop (callback)](../event_ui/eventDrop)
- [eventReceive (callback)](../dropping/eventReceive)

These callbacks are part of the standard FullCalendar release and
have been modified to support resources. When an event has been newly dropped on a
resource, the [Event Object's](../event_data/Event_Object) `resourceId` will be
updated to reflect.
