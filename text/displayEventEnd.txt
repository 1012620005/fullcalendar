displayEventEnd *2.0.1*
=======================

Whether or not to display an event's end time text when it is rendered on the calendar.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
Boolean, *default*:

	false // for month and basicWeek views
	true  // for agendaWeek, agendaDay, and basicDay
</div>

As noted above, each view has a specific default. Get fine-tuned control with [View-Specific Options](../views/View-Specific-Options).
A single boolean alone will set the value for all views.

If an event does not have an end date/time, it won't be displayed anyway, regardless of this setting.
