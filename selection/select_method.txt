select
======

A method for programmatically selecting a period of time.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
.fullCalendar( 'select', *start*, [ *end* ] )
</div>

`start` is a [Moment](../utilities/Moment) or anything the Moment constructor accepts.
Same with `end`.

The `end` parameter is exclusive, meaning if you want to your last
full-day selection to be Thursday, then specify Friday.

The `end` parameter is optional.

For the agenda views, whether the selection is "all-day" or not is determined by whether the
given dates have an [ambiguous time](../utilities/Moment#ambiguously-timed).
A string like `"2014-01-22"` has an ambiguous time and will result in an all-day selection.
