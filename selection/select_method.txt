select
======

A method for programmatically selecting a period of time.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
.fullCalendar( 'select', *start*, *end*, *allDay* )
</div>

`start` is a [Moment](../utilities/Moment) or anything the Moment constructor accepts.
Same with `end`. The `end` parameter is exclusive, meaning if you want to your last
full-day selection to be Thursday, then specify Friday.
