select
======

A callback that will fire after a selection is made.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
function( *start*, *end*, *jsEvent*, *view* )
</div>

`start` is a [Moment](../utilities/Moment) indicating the beginning of the selection.

`end` is a [Moment](../utilities/Moment) indicating the end of the selection. It is an exclusive value,
so if the selection is all-day, and the last day is a Thursday, `end` will be Friday.

You can test if the `start`/`end` is timed or all-day by calling `hasTime`
([more info](../utilities/Moment#ambiguously-timed)).

`jsEvent` holds the primitive JavaScript event with information such as mouse coordinates.
If `select` has been triggered via the [select method](select_method), `jsEvent` will be `undefined`.
