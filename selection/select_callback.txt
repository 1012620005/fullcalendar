select
======

A callback that will fire after a selection is made.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
function( *start*, *end*, *allDay*, *jsEvent*, *view* )
</div>

`start` is a [Moment](../utilities/Moment) indicating the beginning of the selection.

`end` is a [Moment](../utilities/Moment) indicating the end of the selection. It is an exclusive value,
so if the selection is all-day, and the last day is a Thursday, `end` will be Friday.

`allDay` is a boolean indicating if entire days were selected (days in month view
or the "all-day" slot in the agenda view) or time slots were selected.

`jsEvent` holds the primitive JavaScript event with information such as mouse coordinates.
If `select` has been triggered via the [select method](select_method), `jsEvent` will be `undefined`.
