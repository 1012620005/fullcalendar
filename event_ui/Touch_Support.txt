Touch Support
=============

Since version 2.7.0, FullCalendar has improved support on touch devices. Touch support is also available in [Scheduler](../../scheduler/) v1.3.0 and later. Touch support includes:

- smooth scrolling
- time-range selection via [longPressDelay]()
- event drag-n-drop/resizing via [longPressDelay]()

In order for the end-user to begin drag-n-dropping events,
**they must first tap-and-hold on the event in order to "select" it!**

Example of an agenda-view event in the selected state:

<img src='../../../pages/docs/_images/touch-agenda.png'
	width='257'
	height='164'
	/>

Example of a timeline-view event in the selected state:

<img src='../../../pages/docs/_images/touch-scheduler.png'
	width='314'
	height='164'
	/>
