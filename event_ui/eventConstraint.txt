eventConstraint *2.2*
=====================

Limits event dragging and resizing to certain windows of time.

<div class="spec" markdown="1">
an event ID, `"businessHours"`, object
</div>

If an event ID is given (most likely a string), events that are being dragged or resized must
be fully contained by at least one of the events linked to by the given event ID.

If `"businessHours"` is given, events being dragged or resized must be fully contained within the
week's business hours (Monday-Friday 9am-5pm by default). A custom
[businessHours] value will be respected.

A custom time-window, an object identical to what [businessHours] accepts, can also be given:

	{
		start: '10:00', // a start time (10am in this example)
		end: '18:00', // an end time (6pm in this example)

		dow: [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
		// days of week. an array of zero-based day of week integers (0=Sunday)
		// (Monday-Thursday in this example)
	}

A specific period of time with concrete start/end dates can also be given, similar to what an
[Event Object] accepts:

	{
		start: '2014-12-01T10:00:00',
		end: '2014-12-05T22:00:00'
	}

For more granular control over constraining event dates/times, use the `constraint` property
on an [Event Source] or the `constraint` property on an [Event Object].
