renderEvents *3.1*
==================

Renders a multiple new event on the calendar in batch.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
.fullCalendar( 'renderEvents', *events* [, *stick* ] )
</div>

This method is similar to the [renderEvent]() method though it accepts an **array of events** as its main argument, to render multiple events at the same time. This reduces the number of event rerenders that must happen, for performance reasons.
