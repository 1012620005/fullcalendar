Background Events *2.2*
=======================

Events that appear as background highlights can be achieved by setting an [Event Object]'s
`rendering` property to `"background"`:

	$('#calendar').fullCalendar({
		defaultDate: '2014-11-10',
		defaultView: 'agnedaWeek',
		events: [
			{
				start: '2014-11-10T10:00:00',
				end: '2014-11-10T16:00:00',
				rendering: 'background'
			}
		]
	});

Result:

Unlike non-background events, background events will not be piped through the
[eventRender](eventRender) callback.


Color
-----

The color of background events can be manipulated by targeting the `fc-bgevent` className, one
of your own custom classNames provided by the [Event Object]'s `className` property, or by explicitly
specifying a color with each [Event Object]'s or [Event Source]'s `color` or `backgroundColor`
properties.


Inverse Backgrounds
-------------------

The spans of time *not* occupied by an event can be colored by setting the `rendering` property
to `"inverse-background"`. Events that share the same `id` will be grouped together when this
rendering happens.
