dateAlignment *3.3.0*
=====================

Determines the first visible day for a Custom or Generic view.

<div class="spec" markdown="1">
String
</div>

When a [Custom View](../views/Custom_Views) or [Generic View](../views/Generic_Views) is being used, and you'd like to guarantee
that the view begins at a certain interval, like the start-of-week or start-of-month,
specify a value like `"week"` or `"month"`.

If not specified, a reasonable default will be generated based on the view's duration.

If a view's range is explicity defined with [visibleRange](), `dateAlignment` will be ignored.
