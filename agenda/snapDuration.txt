snapDuration
============

The time interval at which a dragged event will snap to the agenda view time grid.
Also affects the granularity at which [selections](../selection/) can be made.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
[Duration](../utilities/Duration)
</div>

The default value will be whatever [slotDuration]() is, which defaults to half an hour.
