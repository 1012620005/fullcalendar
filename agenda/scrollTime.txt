scrollTime
==========

Determines how far down the scroll pane is initially scrolled down.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
[Duration](../utilities/Duration), *default*: `'06:00:00'` (6am)
</div>

The user will be able to scroll upwards to see events before this time.
If you want to prevent users from doing this, use the [minTime]() option instead.
