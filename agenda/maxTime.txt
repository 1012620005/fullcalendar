maxTime
=======

Determines the end time (exclusively) that will be displayed, even when the scrollbars have been scrolled all the way down.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
[Duration](../utilities/Duration), *default*: `"24:00:00"`
</div>

The default `"24:00:00"` means the end time will be at the very end of the day (midnight).
