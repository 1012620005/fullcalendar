minTime
=======

Determines the starting time that will be displayed, even when the scrollbars have been scrolled all the way up.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
[Duration](../utilities/Duration), default: `"00:00:00"`
</div>

The default `"00:00:00"` means the start time will be at the very beginning of the day (midnight).
