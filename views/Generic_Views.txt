Generic Views *3.3.0*
=====================

A Generic View is similar to a [Custom View](Custom_View) in that it gives you
complete control over the displayed date range. However, it is much simpler to define.

When your calendar needs to display a *single* view with custom date range logic,
you should use a Generic View instead:

	$('#calendar').fullCalendar({
		defaultView: 'timeline', // or 'agenda' or 'basic'

		duration: { days: 3 }
		// can also specify:
		// - visibleRange
		// - dayCount
	});
