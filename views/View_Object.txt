View Object
===========

An object that is passed to every callback, containing info about the current view.


Properties
----------

`name`
:	Name of one of the [Available Views]() (a string).

`title`
:	Title text that is displayed at the top of the header (such as "September 2009" or "Sep 7 - 13 2009").



Methods
-------

`getStart()`
:	The [Moment](../utilities/Moment) of the view's first visible day.

	In month-view, this value is often before the 1st day of the month, because most months do not begin on the first day-of-week.

`getEnd()`
:	The [Moment](../utilities/Moment) of the view's exclusive end.

	This value is exclusive and will be the day after the last visible day.

`getIntervalStart()`
:	This will be the same value as `getStart()`, **except for month view**, in which case it will be the first of the month.

`getIntervalEnd()`
:	This will be the same value as `getEnd()`, **except for month view**, in which case it will be the day after
	the last day of the month (because it is an exclusive value)
