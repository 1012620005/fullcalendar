businessHours *2.2*
===================

Emphasizes certain time slots on the calendar. By default, Monday-Friday, 9am-5pm.

<div class="spec" markdown="1">
boolean / object. *default*: `false`
</div>

If `true`, the default business hours will be emphasized.
This only applies to the time slots in the agenda [views].
If `false` (the default), there will be no emphasis.

An object may be given to render business hours with fine-grain control over the days/hours.
The object may have any of the following properties:

	{
		start: '10:00', // a start time (10am in this example)
		end: '18:00', // an end time (6pm in this example)

		dow: [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
		// days of week. an array of zero-based day of week integers (0=Sunday)
		// (Monday-Thursday in this example)
	}

More information on specifying times can be found in the [Duration] article.
