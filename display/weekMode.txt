weekMode
========

<div class='removed-notice' markdown='1'>
This method has been deprecated in favor of [fixedWeekCount](), which controls the number of rows,
and the [height]()/[contentHeight]() settings, which can now be set to `"auto"`.
</div>

Determines the number of weeks displayed in a month view. Also determines each week's height.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
String, *default*: `'fixed'`
</div>

Available options:

`'fixed'`
:	The calendar will always be 6 weeks tall. The height will always be the same, as determined by
	[height](height), [contentHeight](), or [aspectRatio]().

	*Use [fixedWeekCount]() as `true` instead.*

`'liquid'`
:	The calendar will have either 4, 5, or 6 weeks, depending on the month.
	The height of the weeks will stretch to fill the available height, as determined by
	[height](height), [contentHeight](), or [aspectRatio]().

	*Use [fixedWeekCount]() as `false` instead.*

`'variable'`
:	The calendar will have either 4, 5, or 6 weeks, depending on the month.
	Each week will have the same constant height, meaning the calendarâ€™s height will change
	month-to-month.

	*Use [height]() as `"auto"` and [fixedWeekCount]() as `false` instead.*
