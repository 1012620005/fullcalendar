firstDay
========

The day that each week begins.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
Integer, *default*: `0` (Sunday)
</div>

The default value depends on the current [lang](../text/lang).

The value must be a number that represents the day of the week.

Sunday=`0`, Monday=`1`, Tuesday=`2`, etc.

This option is useful for UK users who need the week to start on Monday (`1`).
