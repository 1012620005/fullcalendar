weekNumberCalculation
=====================

The method for calculating week numbers that are displayed with the [weekNumbers](weekNumbers) setting.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
`"local"` (default), `"ISO"`, or a function
</div>

Specifying `"local"` causes the locale-specific calculation to be used,
as determined by the calendar's [lang](../text/lang) setting.
This is the default.

Specifiying `"ISO"` results in
[ISO8601 week numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Week_dates).

You may also specify a function, which must accept a single [Moment](../utilities/Moment) and return
an integer week number.
