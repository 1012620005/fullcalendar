windowResizeDelay
=================

Time, in milliseconds, the calendar will wait to adjust its size after
a window resize event occurs.

<div class="spec" markdown="1">
Integer. *default:* `100`
</div>

This delay exists in order to prevent overly frequent size adjustments
while the user drags and resizes their browser window.
