buttonIcons
===========

Determines which icons are displayed in buttons of the header.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
Object, *default:*

	{
		prev: 'left-single-arrow',
		next: 'right-single-arrow',
		prevYear: 'left-double-arrow',
		nextYear: 'right-double-arrow'
	}
</div>

This setting only takes affect when [theme]() is `false`.

A hash must be supplied that maps button names (from the [header]()) to icon strings.
These icon string are transformed into classNames which are styled by FullCalendar's CSS.

If a button does not have an entry, it falls back to using [buttonText](../text/buttonText).

If you would prefer not to display any icons and would rather
use `buttonText` instead, you can set the `buttonIcons` option to `false`.
