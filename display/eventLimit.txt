eventLimit *2.1.0*
==================

Limits the number of events displayed on a day in Month view.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
Boolean, Integer. *default:* `false`
</div>

When there are too many events, a link that looks like "+2 more" is displayed.
The exact action that happens when the user clicks the link is determined by [eventLimitClick]().

A value of `false` (the default) will display all events as-is.

A value of `true` will limit the number of events to the height of the day cell.

An integer value will limit the events to a specific number of rows.
