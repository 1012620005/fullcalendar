eventLimitClick *2.1.0*
=======================

Determines the action taken when the user clicks on a "more" link created by the [eventLimit]() option.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
"popover", "week", "day", [view name](../views/Available_Views), function
</div>

`"popover"` (the default)
:	Displays a rectangular panel over the cell with a full list of events for that day.

`"week"`
:	Goes to a week view, as determined by the views in the [header]().

`"day"`
:	Goes to a day view, as determined by the views in the [header]().

*view name*
:	A literal string name of any of the [Available Views](../views/Available_Views).

*function*
:	A callback function, for executing arbitrary code.


Callback Function
-----------------

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
function( cellInfo, jsEvent )
</div>

`cellInfo` is an object that holds named properties for information about the day cell:

- `date` - the [Moment](../utilities/Moment) date of the day
- `dayEl` - jQuery element for the day cell
- `moreEl` - jQuery element for the "more" link
- `segs` - array of all event "segment" objects for the given day
- `hiddenSegs` - array of only the segment objects that were not displayed prior

`jsEvent` holds the native JavaScript event for the click.

A callback function can return a string value, like `"day"`, that will be processed
as the new value of the setting.


Event Segment Object
--------------------

- `event` - the [Event Object](../event_data/Event_Object)
- `start` - the [Moment](../utilities/Moment) for when this stretch of the event begins
- `end` - the [Moment](../utilities/Moment) for when this stretch of the event ends (exclusive)
- `isStart` - boolean if this is chronologically the first segment for the event
- `isEnd` - boolean if this is chronologically the last segment for the event
