dayRender
=========

A hook for modifying a day cell.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
function( moment, cell ) { }
</div>

This callback lets you modify day cells that are part of the *month*, *basicWeek*, and *basicDay* views.
See [Available Views](../views/Available_Views/).

`moment` is the [Moment](../utilities/Moment) for the given day.

You cannot return a new element. You must only modify the `cell` (a `<td>` element) that is provided.

This callback is called each time a cell needs to be freshly rendered.
